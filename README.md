# Emotion Detection using Face Recognition
  Emotion detection is topic of research now-a-days. This project builds a model that can detect emotions from face images using CNN., YoloV8  Architecture and then AutoML. The model is trained, validated, and tested on a preprocessed and augmented dataset. The best-performing model is used for emotion detection on unseen face images.
